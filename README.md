ðŸ“˜ RIPâ€“OSPF Redistribution & ISP NAT Lab
ðŸ”¹ Overview

This lab demonstrates integrating RIP v2 and OSPF Multi-Area routing protocols, configuring special OSPF areas (Stub, Totally Stub, NSSA), using redistribution, and providing ISP connectivity via NAT.

The project showcases advanced routing, redistribution, and verification techniques, simulating a real-world enterprise-to-ISP connection.

ðŸ”¹ Topology

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

âœ… RIP v2 configuration for edge networks

âœ… OSPF Multi-Area deployment (normal, stub, totally stub, NSSA)

âœ… Virtual Link to maintain backbone continuity

âœ… Redistribution between RIP and OSPF domains

âœ… Default Route Injection for external connectivity

âœ… NAT at R1 for ISP access

âœ… End-to-End Reachability verification with ping & traceroute

ðŸ”¹ Verification

show ip ospf database â†’ confirmed LSAs & backbone design

show ip route â†’ validated redistribution between RIP & OSPF

ping & traceroute â†’ tested end-to-end reachability to ISP (90.0.0.1, 50.0.0.2)

NAT translation confirmed with debug ip nat

ðŸ”¹ Lessons Learned

How different OSPF area types (Stub, Totally Stub, NSSA) affect LSA propagation

Importance of virtual links when backbone rules are broken

Role of default routes & redistribution in reachability

NAT ACL design â€” avoid including external/ISP subnets

Using verification commands effectively in troubleshooting
